## Lab Report 5

### Part 1 – Debugging Scenario
For this lab report, I created my code from scratch. I created two files, `ArraySort.java` and `ArrayTests.java`, and a bash script, `test.sh`.

The file and directory structure:

The content of `ArraySort.java` file:

**Post in EdStem: Student's Bug**
The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is. (Don’t actually make the post; just write the content that would go in such a post.) A template of the format of the post can be found by clicking “New Thread” -> Question -> Debugging on EdStem.

*What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?*
macOS (operating system); VScode (editor); Chrome (browser) 

*Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.*



*Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.*


**TA's Response**
A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try (To be clear, you are mimicking a TA here.)


**Student's Reflection**
Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.

At the end, all the information needed about the setup including:
The file & directory structure needed
The contents of each file before fixing the bug
The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug
A description of what to edit to fix the bug

You should actually set up and run the scenario from your screenshots. It should involve at least a Java file and a bash script. Describing the bug should involve reading some output at the terminal resulting from running one or more commands. Design an error that produces more interesting output than a single message about a syntax or unbound identifier error – showcase some interesting wrong behavior! Feel free to set this up by cloning and breaking some existing code like the grading script or code from class, or by designing something of your own from scratch, etc.

### Part 2 – Reflection
In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from your lab experience in the second half of this quarter that you didn’t know before. It could be a technical topic we addressed specifically, something cool you found out on your own building on labs, something you learned from a tutor or classmate, and so on. It doesn’t have to be specifically related to a lab writeup, we just want to hear about cool things you learned!

Something cool I learned from my lab experience is how the autograder, which grades our PAs in our other classes, is created and why it works the way it does. It was interesting to see how the skills we learned in this class, including commands, vim and bash script, can be applied to create something like an autograder.
